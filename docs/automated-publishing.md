### Best Way to Provide Your Electron DMG on GitHub for Downloads

Congratulations on packaging your Electron app as a DMG and pushing the code to GitHub! Distributing binaries like your DMG (e.g., `QuestEngine.dmg`) on GitHub is straightforward and follows established best practices for Electron apps. The recommended approach is to use **GitHub Releases**, which allows users to download the DMG directly from your repository's release page. This integrates seamlessly with `electron-builder` (from your `package.json`), supports auto-updates via `electron-updater`, and keeps your source code separate from binaries.

GitHub Releases automatically generates download links, tracks stats, and handles versioning. Avoid committing the DMG to your main branch (add it to `.gitignore`), as it's large and not version-controlled code. Instead, upload it during releases.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up Downloads

1. **Create a GitHub Release**:

   - Go to your repository on GitHub (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/questengine`).
   - Click **Releases** in the right sidebar > **Draft a new release**.
   - **Tag Version**: Use semantic versioning (e.g., `v0.1.0` based on your earlier `0.0.0` â†’ `0.1.0` increment). This creates a Git tag automatically.
   - **Release Title**: Something descriptive, e.g., "QuestEngine v0.1.0 - Initial macOS Release".
   - **Description**: Add a changelog (e.g., "First stable release with builder and player UIs. Built for macOS ARM64."). Include installation instructions:
     ```
     ## Installation
     1. Download QuestEngine.dmg.
     2. Open the DMG and drag QuestEngine.app to your Applications folder.
     3. Eject the DMG and launch from Applications.
     ```
     Mention any prerequisites (e.g., macOS 14+ for ARM64).
   - **Upload the DMG**: Drag and drop your `dist/QuestEngine.dmg` (or the full path if built locally). GitHub will host it with a direct download link.
   - **Publish**: Click **Publish release**. The DMG will now be available at `https://github.com/yourusername/questengine/releases/download/v0.1.0/QuestEngine.dmg`.

2. **Automate Future Releases with `electron-builder`**:

   - Since you're using `electron-builder`, configure it to publish releases automatically on `npm run publish` or CI. This uploads the DMG directly to GitHub Releases.
   - Update your `package.json`:
     ```json
     {
     	"build": {
     		"appId": "com.yourcompany.questengine",
     		"productName": "QuestEngine",
     		"publish": [
     			{
     				"provider": "github",
     				"owner": "yourusername",
     				"repo": "questengine"
     			}
     		],
     		"mac": {
     			"target": ["dmg"],
     			"arch": ["arm64"]
     		}
     	},
     	"scripts": {
     		"build": "tsc && react-scripts build", // Adjust for your React setup
     		"dist": "npm run build && electron-builder --mac --publish=never",
     		"publish": "npm run build && electron-builder --mac --publish=always"
     	}
     }
     ```
     - `"publish=never"`: Builds the DMG locally without uploading (for testing).
     - `"publish=always"`: Builds and uploads to GitHub Releases (use with caution; test first).
   - **GitHub Token**: Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope at GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic). Store it securely (e.g., as `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var in CI).
     - Set in your terminal: `npm config set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken YOUR_PAT`.
     - For local testing: Run `electron-builder --mac --publish=always` with the token set as `GH_TOKEN=your_pat npm run publish`.
   - Now, running `npm run publish` will tag the release, build the DMG, and upload it automatically.

3. **Set Up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (Recommended for Automation)**:

   - Create a workflow to build and release on pushes to `main` or tags. This ensures consistent builds without local machines.
   - Add `.github/workflows/release.yml` to your repo:

     ```yaml
     name: Build and Release

     on:
       push:
         tags:
           - 'v*'

     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: macos-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v4
           - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
             with:
               node-version: '20'
           - run: npm ci
           - run: npm run build
           - run: npx electron-builder --mac --arch=arm64
             env:
               GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
     ```

     - Commit and push this file. On your next tag (e.g., `git tag v0.2.0 && git push --tags`), it auto-builds the DMG and creates a release.

   - Add your PAT as a repo secret named `GH_TOKEN` (GitHub Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions).

4. **Update Your README.md**:

   - Guide users to the releases. Add a badge for the latest release:

     ```markdown
     # QuestEngine

     An Electron app with builder and player UIs.

     [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/yourusername/questengine?color=orange)](https://github.com/yourusername/questengine/releases/latest)

     ## Downloads

     Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/questengine/releases/latest).

     - **macOS (ARM64)**: [QuestEngine.dmg](https://github.com/yourusername/questengine/releases/latest/download/QuestEngine.dmg)

     ## Building from Source

     1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/questengine.git`
     2. Install deps: `npm install`
     3. Build: `npm run build`
     4. Package: `npm run dist`
     ```

   - This makes downloads prominent and user-friendly.

#### Why This is the Best Way

- **User-Friendly**: Direct links in Releases are easy to find and share. Supports checksums (SHA256) for verification if added via `electron-builder`.
- **Auto-Updates**: With `electron-updater` (in your deps), users get notified of updates when running the app, pulling from GitHub Releases automatically.
- **Scalable**: Handles multiple platforms (e.g., add Windows `.exe` or Linux `.deb` later). CI ensures reproducible builds.
- **Secure**: Use code signing/notarization (as discussed earlier) to avoid macOS warnings.
- **Free & Integrated**: No extra hosting needed; GitHub handles storage and bandwidth.

#### Potential Gotchas

- **File Size**: DMGs are ~100-200MB; GitHub limits releases to 2GB per file.
- **macOS-Specific**: For ARM64, specify `arch: arm64`. Test on M1/M2 hardware.
- **Versioning**: Always tag releases (e.g., `v0.1.0`) to match your `package.json` version.
- **Testing**: Download the DMG from the release URL and verify it mounts/installs correctly.

If you share your repo URL or current `package.json` build config, I can refine this further. For multi-platform support or troubleshooting, let me know!
